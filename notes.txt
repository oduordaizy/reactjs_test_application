JSX  is more stricter than html. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple 
JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

App.js is the root component file.
You can however create other component files, then export them to the root file.

JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. 
Rules of JSX
1. Return a single root element.
2. Close all the tags.
3. Use camelCase for most things.

JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript insideit—with curly 
braces { }.

{{ and }} - signify objects in JSX

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the 
props you can pass to an <img>:

useEffect runs on every render.
There are several ways to control when a side effect runs.
We should always include teh second parameter which accepts an array. We can optionally pass dependencies to useEffect in this array.
