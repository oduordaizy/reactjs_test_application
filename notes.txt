JSX  is more stricter than html. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple 
JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

App.js is the root component file.
You can however create other component files, then export them to the root file.
